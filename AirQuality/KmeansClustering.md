Use K-means clustering to generate warning for air pollution

Problem:  Can we use K-means clustering to generate categories of low, medium, high, and very high ozone levels
Method:  K-means clustering, 4 centers 
Data set: Number of days with high ozone, year

Problem:  Can we use K-means clustering to generate categories of low, medium, high, and very high PM2.5 particle pollution levels
Method:  K-means clustering, 4 centers 
Data set1: Particle concentration, year
Data set2: Particle concentration
Conclusion:  Using an additional feature, year, changed the predicted clusters, in a way that does not work for categorization of pollution levels.
